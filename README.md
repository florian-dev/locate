# locate
Locate files using a simple managed database. Can find a file name pattern and seek for duplicates files.

Written for Windows. On Linux updatedb and locate commands do the job (except for duplicates seek), and I don't know MacOs.

TODO :
- [ ] using filters for find action (ex: file-size-threshold)
